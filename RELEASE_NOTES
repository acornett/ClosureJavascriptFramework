1.17
-----------
* Upgrade to Closure Library version ‘99cd91’
* Upgrade to Closure Compiler version ‘v20131014’

1.16
-----------
* Addition of ‘ignoreOutputWrapperSyncDebugAndAssert’ parameter to the compiler which, if true, the configured output wrapper will be ignored when generating the synchronous assert and debug files.
* Upgrade to Closure Library version ‘2385’

1.15
-----------
* Inclusion of SourceMaps with generated output.  For more information on how to use SourceMaps in 
your browser, please visit my article on [SourceMaps](http://www.justinleegrant.com/?p=145).  Big
Thanks on that to Patrick Gilmore.
* Upgrade to Closure Compiler version to r2388
* Upgrade to include default Closure Library included with the JSDependency plugin to version 2385. 
* JSDependency plugin uses Maven dependency, so this can be changed in the future.
* Updates to the Error levels.  There are now 4 levels (please note that these ARE case sensitive):
** NONE - Does no error checking.  Just attempts to compile.  If there are issues, it won't tell you unless your code is so bad that it can't even compile it.
** SIMPLE - Will pretty much do the same thing as NONE, except it will print out warnings for everything that is considered bad practice by the google compiler.
** WARNING - The suggested minimum.  This is what the default is when using the command line Python toolings.  This will print warnings on everything that
the google closure team has indicated is bad practice and these will cause a build failure whenever the extremely bad practice code are encountered.
** STRICT - The most extreme (I use it in all my projects).  Anything that is considered bad practice by the google compiler will cause a build failure. 

For a list of the errors that Google has documented, please see the [error list](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/error-ref).

1.14
----------
* Upgrade to Closure Compiler version to r2180
* Upgrade to include default Closure Library included with the JSDependency plugin to version 2180.
* Closure library included as a default now has a version attached to alleviate confusion and accomidate
future changes to the version.

1.13
----------
* Addition of Multithreading capabilities to speed up testing.  This, by default, will use all 
processors available.  If you would like this to remain using 1-2 cores, please adjust the
"maxTestThreads" parameter.  This performance improvement increased speed of processing test cases
by a minimum factor of 4.  Thanks to Gordon Shankman for the help on this.
*  Update of components.xml so that it is no longer necessary to list all of the plugins in the pom file.
This was a bug discovered that would occasionally cause problems if there were interface changes
between two versions.  By default, unless specified by a components.xml, it would use the newest
version of the plugin available.  This could cause issues for those running older code.

1.12
---------
* Upgrade to Closure Compiler version to r1810
* Upgrade to include default Closure Library included with the JSDependency plugin to version 1635.
* Addition of preamble, prologue, and epilogue blocks into code injection.  This allows you to wrap 
any output of the library (for example, in a self executing closure, if that is required).
